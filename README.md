# Adruino-IRreceiver
Useful arduino sketch and libraries for projects based on IR receiving technology.

In the arduino's default libraries folder there is a folder named "RobotIRremote", you must remove this one in order to insert the library "IRremote.h" (otherwise the two libraties with the same name "IRremote.h" will conflict and compromise the correct compilation).

You can download the library from GitHub at the following link https://github.com/z3t0/Arduino-IRremote .

I'm new in GitHub and I apologize for any mistakes I made accidentally.
I hope to have been helpful,
